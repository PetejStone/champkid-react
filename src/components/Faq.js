                                <p>We get many Intro Calls scheduled every week, but we only take on a limited amount of clients every month. These calls help us determine who’s really serious about their business and who can get the best results from our work.</p>

                            What separates Champkid from other top creative agencies?
                            </button>
                            <div class="dropdown-menu clearfix" aria-labelledby="dropdownMenuButton">
                                <p>Primarily because we are not a creative agency. We are specialists in doing one thing: building
                                building Story Funnel Websites that grow businesses</p>
                                <p>Most creative agencies are usually “generalists” that take on all kinds of creative work without any real expertise in any specific area. That’s not us.</p>
                                <p>We have ONE process for achieving results for our clients and it's very effective.</p>
                                <p>Here's why our process is unique:</p>
                                <p>1) Our ability to execute results: Our process is open for anyone to use and discover, but they'll unlikely be able to deliver at the level we can because of our sharp focus and experience. It's our ability to execute and deliver that can't be replicated. This is why our clients often see extraordinary results from our work.</p>
                                <p>2) Our focus is singular: Remember, this is the ONE THING we do over and over and over again. It’s our specialty. We’ve done it thousands of times and our ability to identify gaps and pave the right solution for you can’t be replicated at the level we're doing it. Everything we do always fits within the context of our focus.</p>
                                <p>3) Our frameworks are battle tested: Time always tells, and the internal frameworks we use have stood the test of time and are battle tested to work for your business.</p>

                            Is web development part of what you do?
                            </button>
                            <div class="dropdown-menu" aria-labelledby="dropdownMenuButton">
                                <p>Yes, absolutely. (ChampKid Design actually started out as a full stack web design studio.) We use the Webflow platform to develop websites and have found that it serves our clients perfectly.</p>
                                <p>Webflow allows us to:<br></br>
                                1) Develop your website at an extremely affordable price;<br></br>
                                2) Launch your new website in a fraction of the time it takes other agencies;<br></br>
                                3) Future proof your website with easy prototyping and flexible changes<br></br>
                                4) Outperform your existing platform, like Wordpress, in the areas of speed, efficiency, ease of use and security.</p>
                                <p>Therefore, if you do want us to develop your website we require you to migrate from your existing platform (with the exception of Shopify users). Our migration process is simple, fast and easy.</p>
                                <p>If you're opposed to migrating away from your existing platform, we are happy to work closely with your web developer to make the changes needed to your existing site.</p>

                            Do you do visual branding or should I hire a separate branding agency?

                                <p>Yes we do. Our experience in visual branding ranges from local businesses to having been hired by world class companies, like Teamwork Commerce.</p>
                                <p>However, this is not our primary focus so we do not provide this service unless we've worked with the client in the past with few exceptions.</p>
                                <p>It's no surprise that our clients are often the same companies that hire us for logo design and visual branding because who can design for their business better than the people who designed their website and built their sales funnel?</p>
